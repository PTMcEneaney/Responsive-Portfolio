                    <p>Hello and thanks for visiting my first Portfolio! I recently started taking a
                        Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp and am hoping to use these skills to
                        change careers. Currently I work as a Sales Representative at a Tutoring 
                        company. I speak with students, parents, and even teachers to assess what the 
                        student needs, and I help them get support so they can be successful. It took
                        two years of working with students to realize that I wanted to go back to 
                        school for something I am passionate about.
                        <br><br>
                        I've been in Seattle since fall 2014. I moved here after graduating from the 
                        University of Oregon with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. Instead of moving
                        home to Santa Cruz, California, I decided to spend the summer working in Wyoming 
                        at Yellowstone National Park. I thought it would lead to some clarity about my
                        career path, but I was only more conflicted. Grad school was a huge commitment
                        of both time and money, and I didn't want to rely on my parents for support 
                        or go into more debt.
                        <br><br>
                        I decided to take my chances in Seattle (a city I'd only visited once) and see
                        if I could make it on my own. Knowing only one person there, and keeping just 
                        enough cash reserved to pay for gas back to California, I started looking for 
                        any job I could find. I worked in restaurants (back and front of house), retail, 
                        customer service, and finally sales. I was overjoyed to be making a living wage
                        and be completely independent but predictably each job turned to a grind and I 
                        looked to slightly improve my work-life balance.
                        <br><br>
                        In the summer of 2018, I went to a friend's BBQ. He was the first new friend
                        I made in Seattle and we'd leap-frogged from job to job in tandem, recommending
                        that the other be hired. He told me that he had enrolled in a 6 month Coding 
                        Bootcamp and his enthusiasm was inspiring. We talked about it more in detail, 
                        and I decided that I could handle 6 months of anything. Put my head down, 
                        absorb everything I can and really learn a new skill-set. With the full support
                        of my husband Greg, family and friends, I bit the bullet and enrolled in the 
                        UW/Trilogy Full-Stack course in January 2019, with a class start date in March.
                        <br><br>
                        I am so beyond excited to improve my web development skills and make
                        a career change. I've always been interested in technology and design as my 
                        dad is an Electronic Engineer in Silicon Valley, and my mom is a Graphic 
                        Designer. While I initially shucked my parent's advice and encouragement, I 
                        finally came to my own realization that web develoment is an area I could 
                        really excel at. I am detail orientated, exteremely driven, passionate about
                        both design and function, and not one to give up when things are challenging.
                        This course is literally the first step to actively change my life and I 
                        couldn't be more eager.
